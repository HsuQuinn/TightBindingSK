This doc is written for description of the TBSK code. The original motivation was to simulate the ARPES spectrum, noticed the chinook package, so I made my own SKTB model of the code base, more convenient to continue on this.
= What are Tight Binding models?
== Tight Binding Model
Tight binding models describe the electronic structure of solids and molecules by expanding electronic wave functions in a set of *localized basis functions*, typically *atomic orbitals*. The expansion coefficients (tight-binding parameters) are obtained by fitting to experimental data or first-principles calculations.

These models allow efficient calculation of electronic properties like *band structure, density of states, and conductivity*â€”especially effective when only nearest-neighbor interactions matter.

Construction methods include the Slater-Koster approach, which considers only nearest-neighbor interactions, and the extended tight binding approach, which includes longer-range interactions.

== Slater-Koster Tight Binding
The Slater-Koster method models electronic structures using a simplified Hamiltonian with *nearest-neighbor interactions*. It approximates the system with localized atomic orbitals connected by tight-binding parameters, fitted from experiments or first-principles.

This method efficiently computes properties such as band structure and conductivity, and is valued for its simplicity and accuracy in systems dominated by short-range interactions.
